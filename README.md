# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Project-in-Machine-Learning


Credit card fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning (ML) that aims to identify fraudulent transactions and prevent financial losses for individuals and businesses. Python, with its rich ecosystem of ML libraries, is commonly used to develop fraud detection models. Here's a description of the credit card fraud detection process using ML in Python:

1. Dataset Preparation
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data Analysis
4. Train,Test Splitting
5. Logistic Regression Model
6. Evaluation

Python provides various libraries that facilitate the implementation of these steps in the credit card fraud detection pipeline. Additionally, Python frameworks can be used to develop web-based interfaces for real-time fraud detection systems.
